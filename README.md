## Install Procedures
Download colorgame.html, colorgame.css and colorgame.js. All three files must be in the same directory. Open colorgame.html in a browser. An internet connection is not required.

## How to play
A person must select the right color that matches the RGB number shown in the title.

**RGB Color explanation:**
An RGB color is specified as an integer between 0 and 255 for each of the three primary colors: red, green, and blue. The higher the  number the more intense is the color. RGB Color is shown as follows: rgb(red, green, blue). For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

**Description:**

Win the game by guessing the RGB color number. A person can choose an easy or hard level.
The easy level provides three colors, while hard level provides six colors to choose.
All colors and the position of the colors are generated randomly.
The location of the correct color on the grid is also randomly placed.

**Purpose:**

This is the my first site developing with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
The goal of this exercise is to gain understanding and practice using the DOM and Javascript.

**Highlights:**

This is my first website built from scratch using HTML5 CSS3 and JavaScript.
100% of the functionality and 80% of the styling was completed prior to doing the code-along exercise.
All logic and workflow is original. Additionally, I added the hover and unhover capabilities
of the color choices.

The in-file documentation, shown in the JavaScript file, demonstrates my style in documentation.
It is important in code documentation to reduce trouble shooting time and make it easier to modify.
