A Portfolio Piece

## Install Procedures

## How to play
A person must select the right color that matches the RGB number shown in the title. 

**RGB Color explanation:**
An RGB color is specified as an integer between 0 and 255 for each of the three primary colors: red, green, and blue. The higher the  number the more intense is the color. RGB Color is shown as follows: rgb(red, green, blue). For example, rgb(0, 0, 255) is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

**Description:**

Win the game by guessing the RGB color number. A person has 3 (Easy) to 6 Hard)
choices depending on skill level. The all colors and position of the correct color are random.
Even I do not know the next colors and where the correct color appear

**Purpose:**

This is the first site developed utilizing HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The goal of this exercise is to gain understanding and practice using the DOM and Javascript.
The HTML and CSS is not complexed

**Highlights:**

This is my first javascript built from scratch. 100% of the functionality and
80% of the styling was completed prior to doing the code-along exercise.
I did review the solution for the transition animation and responsive capablities.
All logic and workflow is orignal. Additionaly, I added the hover and unhover capablities
of the color choices
The infile documentation, shown in the javascript file, demostrates my style in documentation.
It is important in code documentation to reduce trouble shooting time and make it easier to modify.
